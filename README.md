Hey! I'm Eduardo, rising Junior @ UPenn and Mexican international student pursuing a Computer Science BSE at SEAS.
I was in the Wharton School of Business from 2020-2022 before transferring to the engineering school, so I'm knowledgeable in business and finance.

I'm a Teaching Assistant (TA) for CIS120 (Programming Languages & Techniques I), one of the largest intro courses at Penn. 
Fluent in CIS theory, skilled in debugging techniques, and experienced with Github and other version control systems.

Interested in SWE, AI/ML, product development, entrepreneurship, finguerstyle guitar, and building meaningful relationships!

I'm currently learning about AI, cloud computing, databases, and big data.

Thanks for reading, and all the best,

-Eduardo
