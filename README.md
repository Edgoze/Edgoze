Hey! I'm Eduardo, senior @ UPenn and Mexican international student pursuing a Computer Science BSE.
Initially at the Wharton School of Business (2020-2022), I decided to change my major to computer science as a sophomore.

Head Teaching Assistant for CIS1200 (Programming Languages & Techniques I), one of the largest intro courses at Penn. 

Interested in software, product development, entrepreneurship, and fingerstyle guitar!
